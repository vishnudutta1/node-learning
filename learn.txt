with the help of http we can create server
for this we import http and use method http.createServer(function).listen(4500)
createServer takes function as an argument.
in the function it takes two argument one is request and another is response
refer basic.js


node.js is single threaded that is it runs single command at a time.

use of a colors npm package see index.js

we can get npm module by simply running npm install

if we dont want to push any file ...we give that file path in .gitignore

nodemon package is a time saving module...with this package we dont have to run our server everytime....it runs our project continuosly

node js is async language thats why it is fast in execution
